[Single Page Web Apps with AngularJS](https://www.coursera.org/learn/single-page-web-apps-with-angularjs/home/welcome) is the class I'm auditing. It's using 1.57 but I'm doing the assignments with 1.75.

[Assignment 1](https://russeby.github.io/coursera-AngularJS/Assignment1) has been finished.

If you have comments, please feel free to discuss them. Just keep in mind, I'm following very specific instructions from the instructor.
